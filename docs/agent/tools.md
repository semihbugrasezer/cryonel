# CRYONEL AI Agent Tools Documentation

This document outlines the available tools and their usage within the CRYONEL AI agent system.

## Tool Registry

### Core Development Tools

#### 1. Filesystem Access (`filesystem`)
- **Purpose**: Read and write files within the CRYONEL codebase
- **Usage**: Code editing, configuration updates, documentation
- **Security**: Read-only access in production environments
- **Examples**:
  - Reading configuration files
  - Updating source code
  - Creating documentation
  - Analyzing logs

#### 2. Web Fetch (`fetch`)
- **Purpose**: Retrieve information from web sources
- **Usage**: Research, API documentation lookup, market data
- **Security**: Restricted to allowed domains and rate-limited
- **Examples**:
  - Fetching cryptocurrency prices
  - Reading technical documentation
  - Checking API status pages
  - Retrieving news and market updates

#### 3. Database Access (`postgres`)
- **Purpose**: Query and manage PostgreSQL database
- **Usage**: Data analysis, reporting, system maintenance
- **Security**: Restricted permissions, read-only for analysis
- **Examples**:
  - Generating trading reports
  - Analyzing user activity
  - System health checks
  - Data integrity verification

### Research and Information Tools

#### 4. Web Search (`brave-search`)
- **Purpose**: Search the web for information
- **Usage**: Research, troubleshooting, staying updated
- **Security**: Filtered results, no sensitive queries
- **Examples**:
  - Finding solutions to technical problems
  - Researching new trading strategies
  - Checking for security vulnerabilities
  - Learning about new technologies

#### 5. GitHub Integration (`github`)
- **Purpose**: Interact with GitHub repositories
- **Usage**: Code management, issue tracking, collaboration
- **Security**: Scoped access tokens, audit logging
- **Examples**:
  - Creating pull requests
  - Managing issues
  - Reviewing code changes
  - Updating documentation

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Security Considerations

1. **Sensitive Data**: Never include API keys, passwords, or other secrets in tool calls
2. **Production Systems**: Use extreme caution when modifying production files
3. **User Data**: Respect user privacy and data protection regulations
4. **Audit Trail**: All tool usage is logged for security and compliance

### Best Practices

1. **Validation**: Always validate inputs before using tools
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all tool calls
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect rate limits and avoid excessive tool usage
4. **Documentation**: Document significant tool usage and decisions

### Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Use web search and documentation tools for research
2. **Implementation**: Use filesystem tools for code changes
3. **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Deployment**: Use database tools to verify system state
5. **Monitoring**: Use web fetch to check system health

## Tool Combinations

### Common Workflows

#### Research and Development
```
1. Web Search → Find information about new feature/issue
2. Filesystem → Read existing code to understand context
3. Web Fetch → Check documentation and examples
4. Filesystem → Implement changes
5. Database → Verify changes work correctly
```

#### Troubleshooting
```
1. Database → Analyze error logs and system state
2. Filesystem → Review relevant code sections
3. Web Search → Research similar issues and solutions
4. Filesystem → Implement fixes
5. Database → Verify resolution
```

#### Deployment and Monitoring
```
1. GitHub → Create deployment pull request
2. Filesystem → Update configuration files
3. Database → Run health checks
4. Web Fetch → Monitor external endpoints
5. Database → Verify system metrics
```

## Tool Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- **Network**: Limited to approved external connections
- **Permissions**: Restricted file system access in production
- **Resources**: Rate limited to prevent abuse
- **Scope**: Limited to CRYONEL-related operations

### Security Boundaries
- **Isolation**: Tools run in isolated containers
- **Audit**: All tool usage is logged and monitored
- **Validation**: Input validation prevents malicious usage
- **Compliance**: Usage must comply with security policies

## Emergency Procedures

### System Issues
1. Use database tools to assess system state
2. Check logs via filesystem access
3. Research solutions using web search
4. Implement fixes cautiously
5. Verify resolution through monitoring

### Security Incidents
1. Immediately report to security team
2. Document all relevant information
3. Avoid using tools that could compromise security
4. Follow incident response procedures
5. Assist with investigation as needed

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Tools
- **Docker**: Container management and deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration and scaling
- **Prometheus**: Metrics and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboard and visualization

### Integration Roadmap
- Enhanced GitHub workflows
- Automated testing integration
- Advanced monitoring capabilities
- AI-powered code analysis

## Support and Troubleshooting

For issues with tools:
1. Check system logs for error messages
2. Verify tool configuration and permissions
3. Test with minimal examples
4. Consult documentation and community resources
5. Report bugs to development team

Remember: Tools are powerful but should be used responsibly. Always prioritize security and user safety in all operations.
